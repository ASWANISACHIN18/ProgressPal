# ProgressPal
A machine learning-based project to analyze and predict student performance based on various factors like attendance, participation, and resource utilization.
Project Overview:
This repository contains code to preprocess student data, train multiple classification models, and visualize results through graphs. The goal is to predict student performance (High, Medium, Low) based on input features like study habits and attendance.
ðŸš€ Features
âœ… Data Preprocessing â€“ Cleans and encodes student data.
âœ… Machine Learning Models â€“ Implements Decision Trees, Random Forest, Perceptron, Logistic Regression, and Neural Networks.
âœ… Evaluation Metrics â€“ Measures model accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
âœ… Graphical Analysis â€“ Generates visualizations for class distributions and student performance trends.
âœ… Student Performance Prediction â€“ Allows user input for predicting new student performance.
ðŸ“Š Dataset
The dataset (AI-Data.csv) contains student-related features like:

Raised Hands Count
Visited Resources
Discussion Participation
Absence Days
Parent Survey Responses
Final Performance Category: H (High), M (Medium), L (Low)
